  <h1>Tech Mobile – Trouble Service Visit SOP – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      This FAQ supports the <strong>PPS – Service – Tech Mobile (Trouble Service Visit)</strong> SOP.
      It is meant to be used together with the process map and detailed SOP Excel files
      for Travel to Site, Perform Site Work, Add Material, Travel Leaving Site,
      Create New SRO, Change Status to Callback, and Change Status to Closed.
    </p>

    <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>1. What is the purpose of the Tech Mobile trouble service SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The Tech Mobile trouble service SOP explains how a technician uses the Tech Mobile app
        to work a trouble service visit from end to end: traveling to the site,
        performing work, recording material, handling additional work or material needs,
        and updating the status of the appointment and SRO properly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It ensures that time, materials, and status are recorded consistently so that scheduling,
        billing, and follow-up work are based on accurate information.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. When should I use this SOP?</summary>
      <p>Use this SOP when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A trouble service appointment has been scheduled (for example, S1 in the process map).</li>
        <li>You are using the Tech Mobile app to travel to the site and perform work for that appointment.</li>
        <li>You need to record labor and material used at the site.</li>
        <li>You may need to schedule additional work or create a new SRO for related work.</li>
        <li>You must decide whether to close the SRO or set it to callback for a return visit.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Who is typically involved in a Tech Mobile trouble service visit?</summary>
      <p>
        The main role in this SOP is the <strong>technician</strong> using the Tech Mobile app.
        However, the process also connects to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service writers / coordinators</strong> who schedule and manage SROs and appointments.</li>
        <li><strong>Parts personnel</strong> who may stage materials for the visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervisors / managers</strong> who review exceptions and callbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>AR / invoicing staff</strong> who rely on accurate labor, material, and status for billing.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. What event starts the Tech Mobile trouble service SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The process begins with <strong>S1 – Appointment is Scheduled for Trouble Service</strong>.
        Once the appointment appears in the technician’s Work Queue, the Tech Mobile SOP governs
        how that appointment is handled from travel through completion or callback.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. How do I properly record travel to the site in Tech Mobile?</summary>
      <p>
        In the <strong>Travel to Site</strong> SOP, the typical steps include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open the Tech Mobile app and go to the <strong>Work Queue</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select the appointment you are traveling to.</li>
        <li>Select the appropriate <strong>travel labor operation</strong> (such as operation 20).</li>
        <li>Tap <strong>Clock In</strong> to begin travel.</li>
        <li>Drive to the site.</li>
        <li>When you arrive, tap <strong>Clock Out</strong> to end travel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This ensures that travel time is recorded correctly and linked to the appointment/SRO.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. How do I record on-site work and material usage?</summary>
      <p>
        In the <strong>Perform Site Work</strong> and <strong>Add Material</strong> SOPs, you typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clock into the on-site service labor operation (for example, operation 10).</li>
        <li>Use the <strong>Materials</strong> section in the appointment details to review planned material.</li>
        <li>Add or adjust <strong>actual material</strong> used, including quantities and item selection.</li>
        <li>Perform the required troubleshooting or repair work.</li>
        <li>Clock out of the labor operation when work on site is finished.</li>
        <li>Update the <strong>work code</strong> if needed (for example, RESI/IND on-site service categories).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These steps keep labor and material aligned with what was actually done at the site.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. When should I use the “Add Material” step in Tech Mobile?</summary>
      <p>
        Use the <strong>Add Material</strong> step whenever you use parts or materials that need to be
        charged or tracked against the SRO and they are not already fully captured in the planned material.
      </p>
      <p>In practice, this means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigate to <strong>Materials</strong> within the appointment details.</li>
        <li>Tap the plus sign to add actual material lines.</li>
        <li>Use the search function to find the correct item(s).</li>
        <li>Enter the correct quantity actually used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This ensures that the cost and stock movement are correctly recorded.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. What are Q1, Q2, and Q3 in the Tech Mobile process map?</summary>
      <p>
        The process map uses three key decision questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Q1 – “Additional Material Needed?”</strong><br>
            Asks whether extra material beyond what was planned is needed to complete the visit.</li>
        <li><strong>Q2 – “Additional Work Required Other Than That Shown in Original SRO?”</strong><br>
            Asks whether there is new work the customer needs that is not covered by the current SRO.</li>
        <li><strong>Q3 – “Can The Additional Work Be Completed At That Time?”</strong><br>
            Asks whether that additional work can be done during this visit or if a return visit is required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These decisions drive whether you add material, create a new SRO, or set the appointment to callback.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. When and why do I create a new SRO during a trouble service visit?</summary>
      <p>
        If Q2 is <strong>Yes</strong> – there is additional work required beyond what the original SRO covers –
        you may need to create a new SRO using the <strong>Create New SRO</strong> SOP.
      </p>
      <p>This is typically done when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The customer requests new work that is not part of the original problem, or</li>
        <li>There is follow-on work that should be tracked, scheduled, and billed separately.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Creating a new SRO helps keep the original trouble visit clear and ensures proper billing and scheduling
        for additional work.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. When should I change the status to Callback?</summary>
      <p>
        Use <strong>Change Status to Callback</strong> when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The problem <strong>has not been fully resolved</strong> during the current visit, and</li>
        <li>A <strong>return visit</strong> or additional work is required.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The SOP typically includes steps to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the SRO status on the appointment details.</li>
        <li>Select the appropriate <strong>callback/hold</strong> status.</li>
        <li>Add a clear note explaining what remains to be done and why the work could not be completed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This allows the Service team to reschedule and plan the follow-up work with accurate information.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. When should I change the status to Closed?</summary>
      <p>
        Use <strong>Change Status to Closed</strong> when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The trouble service work for that SRO is <strong>complete</strong>.</li>
        <li>Labor and material used have been recorded appropriately.</li>
        <li>Any notes or follow-up items have been documented.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Closing the SRO normally removes the appointment from the technician’s work queue and signals that
        the job is ready for invoicing and back-office processing.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. How does this SOP connect to the overall Service-to-Cash process?</summary>
      <p>
        The Tech Mobile trouble service SOP is one piece of the broader
        <strong>Service-to-Cash</strong> flow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer request and scheduling,</li>
        <li>Creation and management of SROs and appointments,</li>
        <li>Technician travel and on-site work,</li>
        <li>Material and labor recording in Tech Mobile,</li>
        <li>Status changes (callback vs closed), and</li>
        <li>Invoicing, collections, and (if needed) warranty handling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Following this SOP helps make sure each trouble service visit is visible, billable,
        and easy to follow for both the field and the back office.
