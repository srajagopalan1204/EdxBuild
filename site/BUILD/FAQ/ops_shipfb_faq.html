  <h1>OPS – Shipping Feedback SOP – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      This FAQ supports the <strong>OPS – Shipping Feedback</strong> SOP (M1 – Shipping Feedback
      at Scott Electric Electrical Distribution). It covers the process steps S1–S10 and the
      key decisions on serial/lot control and physical count requirements, which sit between
      picking and invoicing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

    <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>1. What is the purpose of the Shipping Feedback SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The Shipping Feedback SOP defines how we record what is actually leaving the building
        on each order. It connects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The picked and packed order lines,</li>
        <li>Quantities that are really shipping,</li>
        <li>Serial/lot numbers where required,</li>
        <li>Items flagged for physical count, and</li>
        <li>Freight and other add-on charges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Done correctly, Shipping Feedback keeps inventory accurate and ensures that future
        invoices match the physical shipment.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. Where does Shipping Feedback fit in the end-to-end process?</summary>
      <p>
        Shipping Feedback sits between:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Picking</strong> (pick ticket printed, orders picked and staged), and</li>
        <li><strong>Invoicing</strong> (pre-invoice exception report, invoice processing, and
            invoice to customer).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If Shipping Feedback is incomplete or incorrect, the pre-invoice exception report will
        show problems and invoices may be delayed or wrong.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. What are the first steps in the Shipping Feedback SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The SOP starts with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S1 – Enter or Search for Order #</strong> – identify the order that is shipping.</li>
        <li><strong>S2 – Review the Details on the Order</strong> – confirm lines, quantities,
            and key information.</li>
        <li><strong>S3 – Enter quantity to be shipped</strong> – record the actual quantities
            being shipped for each line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only after these steps do you move into decisions about serial/lot control and physical count.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. What does the “Serial or Lot Controlled Product?” decision mean?</summary>
      <p>
        The decision <strong>D1 – Serial or Lot Controlled Product?</strong> asks whether any
        lines on the order are controlled by serial or lot number.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <strong>Yes</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You <strong>drill into line-item details (S5)</strong>, and</li>
        <li><strong>Enter or select serial/lot numbers (S6)</strong> for the product being shipped.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This ensures that the system knows exactly which units or lots were shipped, which is
        critical for traceability, warranty, and recalls.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. What is “Flag Product to be Counted” and when is it used?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>S4 – Flag Product to be Counted</strong> is used when a product requires a
        <strong>physical count</strong> before shipping.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SOP uses the decision <strong>D2 – Require Physical Count?</strong>. If the answer
        is <strong>Yes</strong>, the product is flagged for counting so that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Someone physically verifies the quantity on hand, and</li>
        <li>Discrepancies can be corrected before the order is shipped and invoiced.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Why is entering the quantity to be shipped as a separate step important?</summary>
      <p>
        Entering the quantity to be shipped in <strong>S3</strong> ensures that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The system knows the actual shipped quantity, not just the ordered quantity.</li>
        <li>Inventory is reduced correctly.</li>
        <li>Shipping documents and eventual invoices reflect what actually left the building.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is especially important when there are partial shipments, backorders, or substitutions.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. What does “Apply Addons” mean in the SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        In <strong>S7 – Apply Addons</strong>, the user applies any appropriate add-on charges
        associated with the shipment, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Freight or delivery charges,</li>
        <li>Handling charges, or</li>
        <li>Other agreed service charges.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This ensures that the order and the future invoice reflect the full cost to serve
        that shipment.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. What does it mean to “Complete the Shipping Feedback Detail”?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>S8 – Complete the Shipping Feedback Detail</strong> is the point where the
        user verifies that all relevant shipping information has been entered, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quantities to be shipped,</li>
        <li>Serial/lot numbers (if applicable),</li>
        <li>Flags for physical count (where required), and</li>
        <li>Applied add-ons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only when this is complete and correct should the user proceed to actually
        “ship” the order in the system.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. What is the difference between “Ship the order” and “Print shipping documents”?</summary>
      <p>
        In the SOP:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S9 – Ship the order</strong> updates the system to show that the shipment
            has occurred, reducing inventory and preparing the order for invoicing.</li>
        <li><strong>S10 – Print shipping documents</strong> produces the paperwork the driver,
            customer, and internal staff use (packing slips, bills of lading, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Keeping these steps distinct makes it clear when the system considers the product shipped.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. How does Shipping Feedback support the Pre-Invoice Exception Report?</summary>
      <p>
        The <strong>Pre-Invoice Exception Report</strong> looks for orders where something does
        not line up—missing shipping feedback, mismatched quantities, or other issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Shipping Feedback is done accurately:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fewer orders appear on the exception report,</li>
        <li>Billing staff can focus on genuine problems instead of data gaps, and</li>
        <li>Invoices can be processed and sent without delay.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. What are common mistakes to avoid in Shipping Feedback?</summary>
      <p>Common pitfalls include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not updating the quantity to be shipped when partial shipments occur.</li>
        <li>Skipping serial/lot entry for controlled products.</li>
        <li>Failing to flag items for physical count when required.</li>
        <li>Forgetting to apply freight or other add-ons that should be billed.</li>
        <li>Marking an order as shipped in the system before details are correct.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoiding these mistakes reduces credit memos, re-bills, and inventory clean-up work later.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. How does this SOP help new users see the bigger picture?</summary>
      <p>
        The Shipping Feedback SOP is part of the larger Order-to-Cash story at Scott Electric:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Orders are entered and picked,</li>
        <li>Shipping Feedback records what is actually going out the door,</li>
        <li>Exceptions are caught before invoicing, and</li>
        <li>Invoices and payments follow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Understanding Shipping Feedback helps new users see how their actions on each order
        affect inventory accuracy, customer satisfaction, and the quality of financial data.
