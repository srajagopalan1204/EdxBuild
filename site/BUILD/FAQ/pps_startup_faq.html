  <h1>PPS Generator Startup SOP – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      This FAQ supports the <strong>PPS – Service – Generator Startup</strong> SOP.
      It is meant to be used together with the process map and detailed SOP slides.
    </p>
  </div>

  <section aria-label="FAQ list">
    <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>1. What is the purpose of the PPS Generator Startup SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The PPS Generator Startup SOP explains how Palco Power Systems’ Service team handles
        generator startups from the first customer request through scheduling, performing the
        startup, and registering the unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It connects the day-to-day steps (incidents, SRO, scheduling, pick tickets, shipping
        feedback, technician work, and registration) to the broader Service-to-Cash workflow.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. When should I use this SOP?</summary>
      <p>Use the Generator Startup SOP when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A customer calls or is scheduled for a <strong>generator startup</strong>.</li>
        <li>You need to confirm whether Palco sold the generator and locate the original sale.</li>
        <li>You must create or update a <strong>Start-Up Incident</strong> and/or <strong>SRO</strong>.</li>
        <li>You are scheduling a technician to perform a startup and making sure the unit is registered afterwards.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Who is typically involved in generator startup at PPS?</summary>
      <p>
        The overall Service-to-Cash workflow involves several roles, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Writers / Coordinators / Supervisors / Managers</strong> – handle calls, incidents, SROs, scheduling, and billing coordination.</li>
        <li><strong>Technicians</strong> – perform the startup and note callbacks or additional service needs at the customer site.</li>
        <li><strong>Parts Personnel</strong> – stage the parts that will be needed for the startup.</li>
        <li><strong>AR / Invoicing / Warranty staff</strong> – verify payment, process invoices, and handle warranty claims where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. Where is most of the generator startup work actually performed?</summary>
      <p>
        Most startups and related service work are performed <strong>at the customer’s site</strong>.
        Very rarely is this service performed at Palco’s facility.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. What triggers the Generator Startup SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The process map shows <strong>S1 – Customer Calls for Start-Up</strong> as the starting point.
        The call (or scheduled request) for startup is what triggers the SOP.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this initial contact, you should gather or confirm key information such as customer details,
        site information, unit details, and timing expectations.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. What is the decision at D1 and why is it important?</summary>
      <p>
        Decision <strong>D1</strong> asks: <em>“Did we sell the generator?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This matters because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the generator <strong>was</strong> sold by Palco, you can usually find the original sale order and related records.</li>
        <li>If the generator <strong>was not</strong> sold by Palco, the work may be handled as a different type of billable service, often following a “Service Order Process at Charge” SOP and local billing rules.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. What is the decision at D2 and how does it affect the next steps?</summary>
      <p>
        Decision <strong>D2</strong> asks: <em>“Do you know the original order number?”</em>
      </p>
      <p>If the answer is <strong>Yes</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You proceed to <strong>S2 – Order Inquiry</strong> using the known order number.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the answer is <strong>No</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You proceed to <strong>S5 – Order Inquiry Using Serial Number</strong>, and if needed,
            <strong>S6 – Create New Unit</strong> so the unit is properly set up in the system.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. Why do we “Check with AR to Verify Payment in Full” (S3)?</summary>
      <p>
        Step <strong>S3</strong> ensures that payment has been received in full or that acceptable
        payment terms are in place before committing PPS resources to a startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Verifying payment with AR protects both the customer and Palco by avoiding surprises after
        the service work is scheduled or completed.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. What happens in “Create Start-Up Incident” (S4)?</summary>
      <p>
        In step <strong>S4 – Create Start-Up Incident</strong>, the Service team creates an incident
        in the system that captures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer and site details,</li>
        <li>Unit information (order number or serial number-based),</li>
        <li>Scope of the startup work, and</li>
        <li>Any notes or special conditions that should be carried into the SRO and schedule.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This incident becomes the backbone for downstream actions such as adding lines, scheduling,
        and billing.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. How do “Add Start-Up Notes” (S8) and “Add Line” (S9) fit into the process?</summary>
      <p>
        After the incident is created, the SOP has specific steps to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S8 – Add Start-Up Notes</strong> – capture technical and customer-facing details
            that the technician and back-office teams need.</li>
        <li><strong>S9 – Add Line</strong> – add the appropriate charge lines or items to the SRO
            so that materials, labor, and other billable elements are recorded correctly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Clear notes and correct lines help avoid rework, billing errors, and confusion at the site.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. What do “Schedule,” “Print Pick Ticket,” and “Shipping Feedback” cover?</summary>
      <p>The SOP steps show:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S10 – Schedule</strong> – assigning the startup to a technician and setting the date/time.</li>
        <li><strong>S11 – Print Pick Ticket</strong> – printing the pick ticket so that parts and materials
            can be staged and loaded for the job.</li>
        <li><strong>S12 – Shipping Feedback Ship</strong> – updating the system to confirm that parts
            and materials have been shipped or issued for the startup.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these steps make sure the technician has what they need at the site and that inventory
        records stay accurate.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. What happens when the technician performs the startup (S13)?</summary>
      <p>
        In <strong>S13 – Tech Performs Start-Up</strong>, the assigned technician goes to the site,
        performs the startup according to manufacturer and Palco procedures, and records:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Startup results and readings,</li>
        <li>Any callbacks or additional service that may be needed, and</li>
        <li>Any issues that could affect warranty, safety, or reliability.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These notes flow back into the SRO and, where needed, follow-on work or warranty processing.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>13. Why is “Register a Unit” (S14) important?</summary>
      <p>
        Step <strong>S14 – Register a Unit</strong> ensures the generator is properly registered
        with the manufacturer after startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Registration is critical because it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ties warranty coverage to the correct unit and in-service date,</li>
        <li>Supports future warranty claims and service history, and</li>
        <li>Helps both Palco and the manufacturer support the customer over the life of the equipment.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>14. How does this SOP connect to the overall Service-to-Cash process?</summary>
      <p>
        The Generator Startup SOP is a specific “sub-SOP” that fits within the broader
        <strong>Service-to-Cash</strong> workflow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer request / scheduling,</li>
        <li>Incident and SRO creation,</li>
        <li>Parts planning and logistics,</li>
        <li>Technician work at the site,</li>
        <li>Unit registration, and</li>
        <li>Invoicing, payment, and (if applicable) warranty claims.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Following the SOP helps keep each of these pieces aligned and reduces surprises for the
        customer, the technician, and the back office.
