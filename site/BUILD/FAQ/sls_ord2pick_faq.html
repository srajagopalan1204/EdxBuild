      <summary>6. When should I review “Taxes &amp; Totals,” and what should I look at?</summary>
      <p>

          Credit, or support to correct the issue – before continuing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This prevents incorrect charges from reaching the customer or causing rework later.</p>

      <summary>9. What happens if the sales order is placed on credit hold?</summary>
      <p>
        In the overall process flow, a credit hold is a decision point. If the order is placed on credit hold:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A notification is sent to <strong>Credit</strong> for review.</li>
        <li>
          If credit is restored or COD / credit-card payment is accepted, the order can move forward to
          printing the customer acknowledgement and pick ticket.
        </li>
        <li>
          If credit is <strong>not</strong> restored, Sales is informed to <strong>cancel the order and update
          the reason</strong>, under manager guidance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. When should I collect credit card or COD payment in this process?</summary>
      <p>
        In the process map, collection of credit card or other payment is shown after you
        have confirmed the order details and Taxes &amp; Totals.
      </p>
      <p>In practice, you should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review the order lines and <strong>Taxes &amp; Totals</strong> first,</li>
        <li>Then collect the <strong>COD / credit-card payment</strong> or confirm the terms,</li>
        <li>Then finish the order so it can proceed to pick and invoice.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always follow your branch’s local procedures for payment handling.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. How do I print the customer acknowledgement and pick ticket?</summary>
      <p>
        After the order is complete and any credit or tendering issues are resolved,
        the process flow shows <strong>“Print Customer Acknowledgement and Pick Ticket”</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>In the system, you will typically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the appropriate <strong>Print</strong> or <strong>Report</strong> function from the order header or actions menu,</li>
        <li>Select the required outputs (Customer Acknowledgement, Pick Ticket), and</li>
        <li>Confirm the correct printer / location for your branch.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Follow your branch-specific instructions for where each document should print and who receives it.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. What is the final step in this SOP and how does it link to the next SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The final step in this SOP is typically summarized as
        <strong>“Proceed to the Pick to Invoice SOP”</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the customer acknowledgement and pick ticket have been printed,
        responsibility moves from Sales Order Entry to the
        <strong>Pick to Invoice</strong> SOP, which covers warehouse picking, shipment confirmation,
        and invoicing activities.
