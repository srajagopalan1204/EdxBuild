  <h1>OPS – Pick to Invoice SOP – Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>
      This FAQ supports the <strong>OPS – Pick to Invoice</strong> SOP.
      It is meant to be used together with the process map and detailed training materials
      for Shipping Verification, Shipping Feedback (no change / some change), DQT Proof of Delivery,
      Pre-Invoice Exception Reports, and Invoice Processing.
    </p>

    <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>1. What is the purpose of the Pick to Invoice SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The Pick to Invoice SOP defines how orders move from <strong>picked and packed</strong>
        in the warehouse to <strong>accurate invoices</strong> in the system.
        It connects physical steps (picking, packing, shipping, proof of delivery)
        with system steps (shipping feedback, exception checking, invoice processing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Following this SOP makes sure that what ships from Scott Electric matches what is invoiced,
        reducing rework and billing disputes.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. When does the Pick to Invoice SOP start and end?</summary>
      <p>
        The SOP starts <strong>after the pick ticket has been printed</strong> for an order
        and the warehouse begins working the pick (S1).
      </p>
      <p>
        It ends when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shipping feedback is complete,</li>
        <li>Any exceptions have been reviewed and corrected, and</li>
        <li>Invoices have been processed and sent to the customer,
            moving the order into the <strong>Invoice to Cash</strong> stage.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Who is involved in the Pick to Invoice process?</summary>
      <p>
        Depending on the location, the process may involve:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Warehouse and shipping staff</strong> – pick, stage, pack, load, and handle paperwork.</li>
        <li><strong>Drivers / route personnel</strong> – deliver product and capture proof of delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Customer pickup counter staff</strong> – handle will-call orders.</li>
        <li><strong>Supervisors / managers</strong> – review exceptions and monitor process health.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing / AR staff</strong> – run invoice processing and handle exceptions before invoices go out.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. What do S1, S2, and S3 represent in this SOP?</summary>
      <p>
        The early steps are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S1 – Pick Ticket Printed in Warehouse</strong> – signals that the order is ready to be picked.</li>
        <li><strong>S2 – Orders Picked and Staged (Packed)</strong> – product is pulled, checked, and staged/packed for shipment or pickup.</li>
        <li><strong>S3 – Shipping Verification and Packing</strong> – final verification that the right material and quantities are staged and properly packed for the chosen delivery method.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These steps make sure the physical order is correct before it leaves the building.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. Why are there separate shipping feedback steps and bins (S4 vs S11)?</summary>
      <p>
        The SOP differentiates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>S4 – Shipping Feedback with No Change</strong> – shipments where the shipped quantity and lines match the original order.</li>
        <li><strong>S11 – Shipping Feedback with Some Change</strong> – shipments where quantities or lines changed (backorders, substitutions, cancellations, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Using separate <strong>paperwork bins</strong> for these ensures that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Clean” shipments (no change) can flow smoothly to invoicing, and</li>
        <li>Shipments with changes can be reviewed more closely for exceptions before invoices are created.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. What is the role of DQT Proof of Delivery (S10)?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>S10 – DQT Proof of Delivery</strong> confirms that the goods were delivered
        or picked up as expected and that proof (signed documents, electronic confirmation, etc.)
        is available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof of delivery supports:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Exception handling (for example, shortages vs. documentation),</li>
        <li>Customer service when questions arise, and</li>
        <li>Billing and collections when payment is delayed or disputed.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. What is a Pre-Invoice Exception Report and why is it important?</summary>
      <p>
        The <strong>Pre-Invoice Exception Report (S6)</strong> lists orders that have issues
        that could cause incorrect invoices, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Missing or incomplete shipping feedback,</li>
        <li>Quantity or line changes not yet reconciled,</li>
        <li>Pricing, terms, or tax issues that need review, or</li>
        <li>Orders with unusual statuses or missing proof of delivery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By correcting these exceptions before running invoice processing, the team reduces
        credit memos, rebills, and customer disputes.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. What happens in “Review and Take Appropriate Action” (S9)?</summary>
      <p>
        In <strong>S9</strong>, the responsible person (often a supervisor or billing specialist):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reviews each exception on the report,</li>
        <li>Checks shipping paperwork, shipping feedback, and system details,</li>
        <li>Corrects or completes missing information, and</li>
        <li>Decides whether the order is ready for invoicing or requires further follow-up.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only after these actions are complete should the order move forward to invoice processing.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. What does “Run Invoice Processing” (S7) actually do?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>S7 – Run Invoice Processing</strong> is the step where the system creates and posts
        invoices for orders that have passed exception review.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this step:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eligible shipments are converted into invoices,</li>
        <li>Revenue and cost postings are made in the system, and</li>
        <li>Open items are created for customers in the accounts receivable module.</li>
      </ul>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. What is covered by “Invoice to Cash / Invoice to Customer” (S8)?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>S8 – Invoice to Cash / Invoice to Customer</strong> covers the handoff from
        invoice creation to the cash cycle:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Invoices are delivered to customers (print, email, EDI, etc.),</li>
        <li>Any special billing instructions are followed, and</li>
        <li>The order moves fully into the <strong>cash collection</strong> process
            (payments, credits, and collections).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the detailed cash process may be covered in a separate SOP, Pick to Invoice must
        be completed correctly for the Invoice to Cash steps to work smoothly.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>11. How does Pick to Invoice connect with the previous and next SOPs?</summary>
      <p>
        Pick to Invoice is part of a larger chain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It assumes the <strong>“Print Pick Ticket”</strong> SOP has been completed successfully.</li>
        <li>It feeds into the <strong>“Invoice to Cash”</strong> and related AR/collections SOPs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thinking end-to-end (Order Entry &rarr; Pick &rarr; Ship &rarr; Invoice &rarr; Cash)
        helps users see why each step, bin, and exception check matters.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>12. Why does the SOP mention Infor’s Process Intelligence?</summary>
      <p>
        The note about <strong>Infor Process Intelligence</strong> means that the SOP
        was not created in isolation; it was built and checked against actual Infor
        system flows and data.
      </p>
      <p>
        For users, this means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The steps are grounded in how the system really behaves, not just in theory.</li>
        <li>Following the SOP helps keep system data, paperwork, and physical operations aligned.</li>
        <li>Deviating from the SOP is likely to create exceptions and clean-up work later.</li>
      </ul>
