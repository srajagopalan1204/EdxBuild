s21. confirm pricing — selling products for highest price paid if a customer places an order for a product and has historically paid a higher price than the price that defaults in sales order entry, you can set system options to force the higher price for that product and customer. this ensures that the customer is not offered the product at a price less than they are accustomed to paying, and you receive the highest margin on the sale. this may also encourage customers to agree to a contract price to receive a better price in the future. to implement the highest price paid pricing search, you must set two options in sa administrator options-documents-sales orders: months history and exclude level 2. these options define the number of months of sales history to search for the highest price, and whether to exclude price type level 2 sales in the search. the highest price paid search is not conducted if the original default price was determined using a contract price. a contract price is a price type level 1 (customer/product) pd pricing setup record. the contract price is not changed by the highest price paid search. additionally, if you use price type level 2 pricing records (cust/prod price type, cust/prod line, cust/prod cat, or cust/rebate type), and the exclude level 2 option is selected, any prices that originally default on the sales order line using level 2 pricing records are not overridden by the highest price paid. if you use promotional pricing, you still have the option to choose between the promotional price and non-promotional price. the non-promotional price reflects the highest price, if it applies. if you do not have permission to select a promotional price (the access promo price in oe option in sa operator setup-entry options is not selected), the promo price default selection in sa administrator options-documents-sales orders determines the price to use: lowest, promo, or regular. this automatic selection may result in the promo price instead of the highest price being selected. you can override contractual level pricing with multiple level price search. this pricing search can conflict with the highest price paid search. we recommend you select one method or the other, not both. when a sales order line price is replaced with a higher price by this search, the order number, suffix, and line number are stored on the new order line. in addition, the price origin code is set to “h”. this code is displayed in sales order inquiry and sales customer pricing inquiry. to prevent the highest price search in sales customer pricing inquiry, select return/ignore highest price. run the sales order master list report to see the highest price order and line that affected the highest price calculation. this is printed under the original system line data section. s22. add lines to sales order — add more lines using one of the methods discussed s3. enter the quantity required — before entering the quantity ensure that the product is available so the delivery requirements of the customer are met s4. add additional product to sales order — by searching for it and ading after entering the qualtitiy s5. shopping list entry — ou can access the shopping list feature from line entry menu in sales order entry-select products. you can create a shopping list that is based on promotional products, past sales, previous orders, product lists, and infor cpq product configurations. promotional products are based on pricing records in pd pricing setup. past sales and previous orders are based on the customer's transaction history. product lists are set up in product list setup. product lists are often used to sell slow-moving products or overstocked products. products configured in cpq can be returned as individual shopping list components. use the shopping list function to perform these actions: select products from a customer’s ordering history within a month/year range. select products that are listed in the ordering history and automatically batch load the products into the sales order as separate line items. select products from a list of specific previous orders or from a specific product list. use the shopping list to show a list with these elements: all of the products a customer has ordered in the last two months the last quantity ordered for each product the last price that was given for each product past sales totals for products by month you can select individual products from the shopping list to add to the order, or add all products from the shopping list to the order. you can change the quantity to order for each product. s6. select shopping list type — promotional products shopping list promotional products are products that are on sale at a special price or discount for a limited time. promotional pricing records are set up in pd pricing setup at either the product or product price type level. when you add the product to the customer’s order, the price is obtained from pd pricing setup. the promotional price is then charged to the customer. you can view pricing detail in the pricing view in the add line item section of sales order entry. to view all current promotions, select the shopping list option and then click promotional products. recalling a large number of records can affect your system’s performance. to minimize the number of records to sort through, specify the maximum number of records to display. you can also filter the records that are displayed in customer order pad filter setup to view only specific customers, customer types, and product categories. when filters are defined, those particular records are not displayed in the shopping list. when you select to automatically launch this style, each time the shopping list is accessed, promotional pricing is launched. if you clear the automatically launch this style option, you can select from the different styles available. past sales shopping list you can select products from a list of products that the customer has purchased previously by selecting past sales. specify a range of months and the number of product records to recall for the shopping list. you can also include past sales for these types of products: nonstocks products products that were sold from the warehouse on the order to the customer on the order and the customer's ship tos. products that were sold to the customer or ship to on the order from any warehouse. the recommended quantity for the products in the shopping list is based on the first order found. to see past sales information as monthly totals, use the past sales window. previous orders shopping list customers often order the same product repeatedly, or duplicate entire orders. the previous orders function lets you import product from up to 10 past orders into the current shopping list. these orders can originate from any customer account. because your pricing might have changed since the original order was shipped, you can have the system re-price the products or retain the original pricing. the recommended quantity is based on the first order found. product list shopping list product lists are user-defined lists of product set up in product list setup. sales personnel or inbound call centers use these lists primarily to promote product sales on slow-moving products or overstocked products to their customers. if you use a product list, select the product list type and specify the number of products you want to recall. the product list is then moved into your current shopping list. the recommended quantity is based on the product list. s7. enter list criteria — the ordering history information is from the sm extended totals warehouse/product by customer report. the information contained in this file is automatically updated each time sales entry processing invoice processing report is generated, if the customer, product category by warehouse options are selected in sa administrator options-sales history-levels. the update sales manager option must also be selected in sales entry processing invoice processing report. you can filter the ordering history information by setting up records in customer order pad filter setup for specific customers or customer types and product categories. when you set up a customer or customer type with product categories in customer order pad filter setup, those product categories are not displayed when you use the shopping list. s8. enter quantity — before entering the quantity ensure that the product is available so the delivery requirements of the customer are met s9. add additional products to the list — by searching for it and ading after entering the qualtitiy or from other shopiing lists s999. you have
