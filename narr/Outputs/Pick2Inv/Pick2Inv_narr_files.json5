Pick Tickets can be manually printed, or If TWL is being used in the warehouse, the order would be dropped to TWL to be pulled. In a standard paper-style warehouse, the Pick Ticket would be printed in the warehouse for the warehouse personnel to pull.\n\nIn a standard paper-style warehouse, the Pick Ticket is the primary document the warehouse staff follow when pulling material. The Pick Ticket should include the recommended quantity to pick, the Ship Quantity, the Unit of Measure associated with that quantity, and the Bin Location(s) where the product(s) can be found in the warehouse. Additional information is available including product description information, UPC data, and Pricing information if desired. The warehouse staff will mark the quantity pulled for each line of the order, including any necessary Lot or Serial # information, and initial the picked to confirm they were the person responsible for pulling that order.\n\nAfter the Picking process has been completed, the shipping department should verify the order has been picked correctly, and initial the pick ticket. The material is then packaged for shipment, and any necessary shipping or carton labels can be printed. Once the order has been verified and packed, the Shipping Feedback process should be completed by the shipping department or an office clerk to update the order with the actual quantities shipped, any required Lot or Serial # information, and to apply any relevant Addon charges for freight, handling or other misc. fees. \n\nA number of shipping documents can be generated from CSD, including a Packing List, Delivery Document, Bill of Lading, and Commercial Invoice.  \n\nMost distributors perform Invoicing as a standard scheduled process that runs each evening; however, it is not uncommon for exceptions to occur during the invoicing process that can prevent a few orders from being properly invoiced. There are a myriad of exceptions that can occur on different orders; however, a few common reasons are: On Hand < Qty Shipped, related PO or Transfer not received, Order on Hold, etc... The Pre-Invoicing exception report allows you to identify orders with exceptions so you can take the appropriate action to resolve the exception condition before the nightly scheduled invoicing process. Any unresolved or new exceptions that exist at the time of Invoicing will prevent the order from moving from the Shipped Stage to the Invoiced Stage, and an Exception report will be generated listing all orders that failed to Invoice.  \n\nCustomer Invoices can be set to the customer automatically based on Invoice Ecomm settings on the Customer and Ship To Setup records. Invoices, as well as Acknowledgements & Statements, can be sent via email, fax, USPS (paper), or through the EDI process. Additional Customer email address information set up in the Contacts Contextual App can be leveraged to allow for multiple email recipients."

Pick ticket printed at Warehouse- — Function acronym: OEEPP\n\nUse this report to print pick tickets so that the products can be picked from the warehouse and staged for shipping. Optionally, you can print Integrated Barcode pick labels or cartonization package labels. Run this report after a sales order is created, and you have optionally sent an acknowledgment to the customer.\n\nYou can print pick tickets automatically from Sales Order Entry and Sales Entry Shipping Feedback Report through this function. You can also print pick tickets with Sales Entry Back Order Fill Report after an order is filled.\n\nA temporary lock is placed on orders until picking is complete. Because pick tickets can be printed from multiple functions, the lock ensures that the pick tickets are printed only once. If the Sales Entry Back Order Fill Report or Sales Entry Pick Tickets Report does not finish processing, the user that created the order can unlock the order in Sales Order Entry.\n\nPrinting pick tickets\nYou can only print pick tickets for Stock Orders (SO), Blanket Releases (BR) and Counter Sales (CS) order types. Printing pick tickets changes orders from Stage 1 (Ordered) to Stage 2 (Picked), unless the total shipped quantity on the order is zero. If the stage is already Stage 3 (Shipped), it is not changed. Pick tickets cannot be printed for orders that have been invoice processed.\n\nIf Line Ship Complete is selected for a line item and these conditions are met, a pick ticket is not printed for the line:\n\nThe customer or ship to accepts back orders.\nThe line cannot be filled in its entirety.\nWhen you run the pick ticket report, the shipped quantity for a Line Ship Complete line is set to zero and the line is included on the back order. The status of the Line Ship Complete option is copied from the original order to the back order. The shipped quantity on the back order is updated with the shipped quantity value from the original line. Stock is re-allocated to the line if stock is available after the Sales Entry Processing Back Order Fill Report is run.\n\nYou can use one of these methods to print pick tickets for Return Merchandise (RM) order types:\n\nPrint the print tickets from Sales Order Entry\nList the RM order on the Sales Entry Pick Tickets Report"
