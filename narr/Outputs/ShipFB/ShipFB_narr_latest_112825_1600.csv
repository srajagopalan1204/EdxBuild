Cycle counting means counting a limited number of different products or bins each night. The system€™s cycle counting is true cycle counting. This means there are no report ranges that can be entered. The count is performed in bin location order without regard to which products are supposed to be in the bins, and the count is done shelf to sheet. If several products have the same bin location, the products are sorted in product order. Build-on-demand kits and labor products are excluded from this process. Products with the Count Required field selected in Product Warehouse Product Setup - General are included if they are in the selected bin location.

The following evening, the count sheets start with the next available bin location. If the product is flagged as a must count, the letter c prints next to the expected quantity on the count sheet. Note: If a cycle count run number is open when a physical count run is created, any adjustments updated for the cycle count are made again when the physical count is updated. No cycle count runs should be made while a physical count run is in an open stage that has not been updated.

Enter or search for Order#-Sales > Entry > Order Function acronym: OEET Use this function to import an Excel spreadsheet to create stock orders and quote orders. After you import the information from the spreadsheet, you can review and edit the information before you submit the orders. To import information and automatically create the orders, you must use a specific spreadsheet format. If you do not use the correct format, the import is invalid. See Creating sales orders from an Excel spreadsheet and Excel spreadsheet formatting for sales orders. Use this tab to review about sales order totals and related information such as key order dates, discounts and terms, and addons. You can also review this information: A signature, if one was captured in Sales Order Entry when the order was placed or on a handheld device when the order was delivered . The operator ID and date of the last change to the order. If enabled, static information that is related to National Program functionality is displayed in the Order Totals section. Addon descriptions and amounts are displayed if there are more than four addons on the order. S10. Print Shipping Document-Function acronym: OEEPD Use this report to print Delivery Documents for sales orders. The Delivery Document is similar to a pick ticket, but is a customer-facing record of the sales order being delivered by the distributor. It is not an internal control document for warehouse personnel (for example, it would not contain pick ticket-like notes or shipping instructions). The Delivery Document is typically printed after the sales order is picked and would include any changes to the order that might have occurred during picking. Note: For IDM output, delivery document output displays multiple lines when there are multiple bins involved in picking for a single line item. Each bin is displayed on a separate line with the line number. Due to IDM and remapping complexity, this is necessary to display accurate bin quantities. Unlike the pick ticket, printing a Delivery Document does not change the stage of the order or update inventory. The Delivery Document can be set up to include the price. You can set operator security for printing of the document; you can track the number of copies. The Delivery Document can be in print, PDF, or e-mail format. You can print Delivery Documents for the following order types: sales order, counter sale, return merchandise, blanket release. Optionally, you can print BOD Kit Components (non-transferable only), if the Print on Invoice option is selected in Product Setup-General-Kit. S2. Review the details of the Order-Sales > Inquiry > Order Use this tab to see general information about the order, including tender history, credit card information, and operational hold codes. You can expand the Credit Card Details section to view a list of the credit cards that are associated with the order. To view authorization details, expand the record. This information from the credit card processor response file is displayed: The date and time the transaction response was sent The actual reason codes for denial These fields are informational only. You can use these fields for audit history or for troubleshooting S3. Enter adjusted to be shipped-Function acronym: OEES Use this function to ship orders and vendor returns, and modify orders that have been picked from the warehouse and require changes. If you know the order number to ship, you can use the Quick Ship feature. You can perform these tasks in Sales Shipping Feedback Entry: Change order addons, quantity shipped, serial numbers, and lot numbers Automatically fill outstanding backorders Ship all line items on the order Print pick tickets and invoices on demand Change regular orders You cannot cancel or delete an order in Sales Shipping Feedback Entry. Use this page to review and edit the line items on the order. Some fields in the grid are editable. Use the buttons on the grid toolbar to access Warehouse Manager, Re-Reserve, and to Set Qty Ship to Zero. You can process normal and returned lines from this view. If the order is in Stage 1 (Ordered), the Product Setup Warehouse Product quantity reserved is decreased, and the quantity committed is increased before you access the Line Items view. If the order is already in Stage 2 (Picked) or Stage 3 (Shipped), the committed balance is affected if the quantity shipped is increased or decreased. Quantities that are committed have already been picked from the warehouse and may have been shipped. If a line is being returned, on hand quantity is not affected until you perform invoice processing in Sales Entry Invoice Processing Report. Also, if part of the returned quantity is unavailable, the unavailable quantity is not updated until you process invoices. If a back order must be created for any lines that contain a zero quantity shipped, the back order is created based on the Create OE Back Orders At Stage option in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders-Back Orders. This enables Sales Processing Back Order Fill Report to fill the back order when stock is available. From the Line Items view, you can advance to Serial Lots and Kits when you are processing a serial, lot, or kit product. If any of the products on the order are serialized or have lots and are not fully allocated, a warning message is displayed. You cannot invoice process the order until all serial and lot numbers for the order have been allocated. Use the Shipping Feedback Line Items grid to review and edit the line record. Some fields in the grid are editable. Use the actions on the grid toolbar to access Warehouse Manager, Re-Reserve, and to Set Qty Ship to Zero. For orders with a Just In Time disposition, only picked lines are displayed. This message is displayed if you try to ship a Just in Time order that has not been picked: JIT Orders Must Be Picked Before Shipping or Invoice Processing (6123). S4. Flag Product to be counted-Function acronym: ICEPC Use this report to start printing count sheets with the first bin location in the warehouse up to the number of products to count for the current session. Cycle counting means counting a limited number of different products or bins each night. The system€™s cycle counting is true cycle counting. This means there are no report ranges that can be entered. The count is performed in bin location order without regard to which products are supposed to be in the bins, and the count is done shelf to sheet. If several products have the same bin location, the products are sorted in product order. Build-on-demand kits and labor products are excluded from this process. Products with the Count Required field selected in Product Warehouse Product Setup - General are included if they are in the selected bin location. The following evening, the count sheet picks up where the current count sheet ends. Each evening, the last bin location is stored internally on each warehouse record. The following evening, the count sheets start with the next available bin location. If the product is flagged as a must count, the letter c prints next to the expected quantity on the count sheet. Note: If a cycle count run number is open when a physical count run is created, any adjustments updated for the cycle count are made again when the physical count is updated. No cycle count runs should be made while a physical count run is in an open stage that has not been updated. Even with just cycle counts, a remote possibility exists that an item is cycle counted, then set for cycle counting due to an adjustment, and cycle counted again while the first run is still open. Use extreme caution with multiple open run numbers. The Bin Locations and Products record, which does not contain an On Hand quantity, is not automatically deleted when you specify a zero quantity in Product Count Entry. Run the WM Audit Report to delete open bins before you run the Product Entry Cycle Count Report or Product Entry Physical Count Report. Note: It is important for products to be set up with unique bin locations in Product Warehouse Product Setup. This keeps the system running smoothly when generating cycle count sheets. If there are too many duplicates, the system cannot generate your count sheets in a timely manner. Products that are tagged unavailable are not included in the expected quantity. These goods should be physically separate from shelf goods and in a special area that clearly indicates the goods are not to be picked from because they cannot be used for sales. By flagging the product for a physical count forces the Ops team to investigate the Discrepancy between Available inventory and what was physically found. This happens due to a variety of reasons S5.

Print Shipping Document-Function acronym: OEEPD Use this report to print Delivery Documents for sales orders. The Delivery Document is similar to a pick ticket, but is a customer-facing record of the sales order being delivered by the distributor. It is not an internal control document for warehouse personnel (for example, it would not contain pick ticket-like notes or shipping instructions). The Delivery Document is typically printed after the sales order is picked and would include any changes to the order that might have occurred during picking. Note: For IDM output, delivery document output displays multiple lines when there are multiple bins involved in picking for a single line item. Each bin is displayed on a separate line with the line number. Due to IDM and remapping complexity, this is necessary to display accurate bin quantities. Unlike the pick ticket, printing a Delivery Document does not change the stage of the order or update inventory. The Delivery Document can be set up to include the price. You can set operator security for printing of the document; you can track the number of copies. The Delivery Document can be in print, PDF, or e-mail format. You can print Delivery Documents for the following order types: sales order, counter sale, return merchandise, blanket release. Optionally, you can print BOD Kit Components (non-transferable only), if the Print on Invoice option is selected in Product Setup-General-Kit. S2.

Enter adjusted to be shipped-Function acronym: OEES Use this function to ship orders and vendor returns, and modify orders that have been picked from the warehouse and require changes. If you know the order number to ship, you can use the Quick Ship feature. You can perform these tasks in Sales Shipping Feedback Entry: Change order addons, quantity shipped, serial numbers, and lot numbers Automatically fill outstanding backorders Ship all line items on the order Print pick tickets and invoices on demand Change regular orders You cannot cancel or delete an order in Sales Shipping Feedback Entry. Use this page to review and edit the line items on the order. Some fields in the grid are editable. Use the buttons on the grid toolbar to access Warehouse Manager, Re-Reserve, and to Set Qty Ship to Zero. You can process normal and returned lines from this view. If the order is in Stage 1 (Ordered), the Product Setup Warehouse Product quantity reserved is decreased, and the quantity committed is increased before you access the Line Items view. If the order is already in Stage 2 (Picked) or Stage 3 (Shipped), the committed balance is affected if the quantity shipped is increased or decreased. Quantities that are committed have already been picked from the warehouse and may have been shipped. If a line is being returned, on hand quantity is not affected until you perform invoice processing in Sales Entry Invoice Processing Report. Also, if part of the returned quantity is unavailable, the unavailable quantity is not updated until you process invoices. If a back order must be created for any lines that contain a zero quantity shipped, the back order is created based on the Create OE Back Orders At Stage option in SA Administrator Options-Documents-Sales Orders-Back Orders. This enables Sales Processing Back Order Fill Report to fill the back order when stock is available. From the Line Items view, you can advance to Serial Lots and Kits when you are processing a serial, lot, or kit product. If any of the products on the order are serialized or have lots and are not fully allocated, a warning message is displayed. You cannot invoice process the order until all serial and lot numbers for the order have been allocated. Use the Shipping Feedback Line Items grid to review and edit the line record. Some fields in the grid are editable. Use the actions on the grid toolbar to access Warehouse Manager, Re-Reserve, and to Set Qty Ship to Zero. For orders with a Just In Time disposition, only picked lines are displayed. This message is displayed if you try to ship a Just in Time order that has not been picked: JIT Orders Must Be Picked Before Shipping or Invoice Processing (6123). S4. Flag Product to be counted-Function acronym: ICEPC Use this report to start printing count sheets with the first bin location in the warehouse up to the number of products to count for the current session. Cycle counting means counting a limited number of different products or bins each night. The system€™s cycle counting is true cycle counting. This means there are no report ranges that can be entered. The count is performed in bin location order without regard to which products are supposed to be in the bins, and the count is done shelf to sheet. If several products have the same bin location, the products are sorted in product order. Build-on-demand kits and labor products are excluded from this process. Products with the Count Required field selected in Product Warehouse Product Setup - General are included if they are in the selected bin location. The following evening, the count sheet picks up where the current count sheet ends. Each evening, the last bin location is stored internally on each warehouse record. The following evening, the count sheets start with the next available bin location. If the product is flagged as a must count, the letter c prints next to the expected quantity on the count sheet. Note: If a cycle count run number is open when a physical count run is created, any adjustments updated for the cycle count are made again when the physical count is updated. No cycle count runs should be made while a physical count run is in an open stage that has not been updated. Even with just cycle counts, a remote possibility exists that an item is cycle counted, then set for cycle counting due to an adjustment, and cycle counted again while the first run is still open. Use extreme caution with multiple open run numbers. The Bin Locations and Products record, which does not contain an On Hand quantity, is not automatically deleted when you specify a zero quantity in Product Count Entry. Run the WM Audit Report to delete open bins before you run the Product Entry Cycle Count Report or Product Entry Physical Count Report. Note: It is important for products to be set up with unique bin locations in Product Warehouse Product Setup. This keeps the system running smoothly when generating cycle count sheets. If there are too many duplicates, the system cannot generate your count sheets in a timely manner. Products that are tagged unavailable are not included in the expected quantity. These goods should be physically separate from shelf goods and in a special area that clearly indicates the goods are not to be picked from because they cannot be used for sales. By flagging the product for a physical count forces the Ops team to investigate the Discrepancy between Available inventory and what was physically found. This happens due to a variety of reasons S5.
