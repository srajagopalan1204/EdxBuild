The Delivery Document is similar to a pick ticket, but is a customer-facing record of the sales order being delivered by the distributor.\n\nIt is not an internal control document for warehouse personnel (for example, it would not contain pick ticket-like notes or shipping instructions). The Delivery Document is typically printed after the sales order is picked and would include any changes to the order that might have occurred during picking.\n\nNote: For IDM output, delivery document output displays multiple lines when there are multiple bins involved in picking for a single line item. Each bin is displayed on a separate line with the line number. Due to IDM and remapping complexity, this is necessary to display accurate bin quantities.\nUnlike the pick ticket, printing a Delivery Document does not change the stage of the order or update inventory. The Delivery Document can be set up to include the price. You can set operator security for printing of the document; you can track the number of copies. The Delivery Document can be in print, PDF, or e-mail format.\n\nYou can print Delivery Documents for the following order types: sales order, counter sale, return merchandise, blanket release.

        "joined_text": "- S4. Flag Product to be counted — Function acronym: ICEPC\n\nUse this report to start printing count sheets with the first bin location in the warehouse up to the number of products to count for the current session.\n\nCycle counting means counting a limited number of different products or bins each night. The system’s cycle counting is true cycle counting. This means there are no report ranges that can be entered. The count is performed in bin location order without regard to which products are supposed to be in the bins, and the count is done shelf to sheet. If several products have the same bin location, the products are sorted in product order. Build-on-demand kits and labor products are excluded from this process. Products with the Count Required field selected in Product Warehouse Product Setup - General are included if they are in the selected bin location.\n\nThe following evening, the count sheet picks up where the current count sheet ends. Each evening, the last bin location is stored internally on each warehouse record. The following evening, the count sheets start with the next available bin location. If the product is flagged as a must count, the letter c prints next to the expected quantity on the count sheet.\n\nNote:  If a cycle count run number is open when a physical count run is created, any adjustments updated for the cycle count are made again when the physical count is updated. No cycle count runs should be made while a physical count run is in an open stage that has not been updated. Even with just cycle counts, a remote possibility exists that an item is cycle counted, then set for cycle counting due to an adjustment, and cycle counted again while the first run is still open. Use extreme caution with multiple open run numbers.\nThe Bin Locations and Products record, which does not contain an On Hand quantity, is not automatically deleted when you specify a zero quantity in Product Count Entry. Run the WM Audit Report to delete open bins before you run the Product Entry Cycle Count Report or Product Entry Physical Count Report.\n\nNote:  It is important for products to be set up with unique bin locations in Product Warehouse Product Setup. This keeps the system running smoothly when generating cycle count sheets. If there are too many duplicates, the system cannot generate your count sheets in a timely manner.\nProducts that are tagged unavailable are not included in the expected quantity. These goods should be physically separate from shelf goods and in a special area that clearly indicates the goods are not to be picked from because they cannot be used for sales.\nBy flagging the product for a physical count forces the Ops team to investigate the Decrepency between Available invenotry and what was physically found. This happenes due to a variety of reasons"
